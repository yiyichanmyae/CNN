[cats_v_dogs_augmentation.ipynb](https://github.com/yiyichanmyae/CNN/blob/main/tensorflow_dev_assignments/cnn_in_TF/C2W2_Lab1_cats_v_dogs_augmentation.ipynb)
- applying `Data Augmentation` by using `Image Data Generator`
- it shows Data Augmentation can help to avoid `Overfitting`.

[horses_v_humans_augmentation.ipynb](https://github.com/yiyichanmyae/CNN/blob/main/tensorflow_dev_assignments%20/cnn_in_TF/C2W2_Lab2_horses_v_humans_augmentation.ipynb)
- applying `Data Augmentation` by using `Image Data Generator`
- it shows Data Augmentation does not guarantee to solve `Overfitting`.
